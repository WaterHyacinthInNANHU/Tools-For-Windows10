# Tools-For-Windows10

This is a collection of useful tools I liked for windows10.

### Universal Tool Box

> **[PowerToys](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/releases/tag/v0.25.0)**
>
> Microsoft PowerToys is a set of utilities for power users to tune and streamline their Windows experience for greater productivity. Inspired by the [Windows 95 era PowerToys project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_PowerToys), this reboot provides power users with ways to squeeze more efficiency out of the Windows 10 shell and customize it for individual workflows. A great overview of the Windows 95 PowerToys can be found [here](https://socket3.wordpress.com/2016/10/22/using-windows-95-powertoys/).

### Keyboard Remapping

> **[Key Manager](https://atnsoft.com/keymanager/)**
>
> **Key Manager** is a more functional version of the program [**Key Remapper**](https://atnsoft.com/keyremapper/) that, in addition to remapping keys and mouse buttons, has many other useful functions. For example, **Key Manager** allows you to **remap combinations of keys and mouse buttons, key and mouse button sequences, and long presses (press and hold).** You can display your actions in the form of pop-up menus that can be opened with hotkeys, record, edit, and execute macros (key sequences), emulate mouse clicks, type and paste text (including formatted text), instantly fill in forms on websites, launch programs, open websites (you can insert currently selected text into their address parameters), change the layout and case of selected text, manage the power settings of your monitor and computer, control the volume or set it at a certain level, move and resize windows, and much more.

> It really helped me out in the situation that my Zephyrus G14 doesn't have an insert key, which I ultimately remapped to a combination of LAlt+I.
